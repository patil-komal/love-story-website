# Love Story Website - React (Tailwind + Framer Motion)

This is a ready-to-run static React project scaffold for a romantic **Love Story** website.
It includes animations using **Framer Motion** and styling with **TailwindCSS**.

## How to run locally

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed (v16+ recommended).
2. In the project directory run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
3. Open http://localhost:3000

## Notes
- The repository includes placeholders for photos and music. Replace them in `src/assets/` and update `App.jsx`.
- Tailwind is already configured via `tailwind.config.js` & `postcss.config.js`.
- If you get errors about `react-scripts`, you can create the app using Create React App first:
  ```bash
  npx create-react-app love-story
  cd love-story
  # then copy the src/ and public/ files from this project into the CRA project
  ```

## Want me to:
- Add real photos & background music?
- Host the site on Netlify / Vercel and give you the live link?
- Add multi-language support or printable PDF of the story?

Tell me what you'd like and I'll prepare it.
